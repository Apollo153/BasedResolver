# Based Resolver 
# Resolver used only for PenaBlox HVH!
# USE ON A ALTERNATE ACCOUNT THIS WILL GET YOU BANNED IF YOUR CAUGHT!!!
# How to use:
Use a executor ( thats not shitty )
Now you need to bypass Penablox AC, do that by executing the script below
`loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo153/BasedResolver/refs/heads/main/Bypasser'))()`
After executing that check your F9 console for a message to make sure it has been executed correctly
Now inject the main script that is below this text.
`loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo153/BasedResolver/refs/heads/main/Main'))()`
Now check your F9 console again and if it confirmed you should be able to play now.
